# WHEEL OF FORTUNE

### Game Overview

This project is a Wheel of Fortune–style risk–reward game where each spin grants a randomized outcome. Players can earn valuable rewards, but every turn carries the risk of hitting a grenade, which immediately wipes all unclaimed progress and forces a restart.  
The core gameplay revolves around decision-making under uncertainty rather than pure luck.

### Core Gameplay Loop
*The player spins the wheel to receive a random reward.  
*Rewards accumulate as long as the player continues spinning.  
*A grenade outcome causes the player to lose all current rewards and restart from the beginning.  
*At specific points, the player reaches a Safe Zone, where they can:  
Secure and collect all accumulated rewards, or Continue spinning to chase higher rewards at the cost of increased risk.  

### Risk vs Reward Design
-The game emphasizes strategic tension:  
*Continuing past a Safe Zone increases potential rewards but also raises the probability of failure.  
*Stopping early guarantees safety but limits progression.  
*Each decision is meaningful and irreversible, encouraging calculated risk-taking.  
*This structure creates short, intense sessions where players constantly evaluate whether to cash out or push their luck.  

### Key Features
*Randomized wheel outcomes  
*Progressive risk scaling  
*Safe Zone checkpoint system  
*High-stakes failure condition (grenade)  
*Designed for fast, repeatable play sessions
